# Abstract

Humans have consciousness as the ability to perceive events
and objects: a mental model of the world developed from
the most impoverished of visual stimuli, enabling humans to
make rapid decisions and take actions. Although spatial and
temporal aspects of different scenes are generally diverse, the
underlying physics among environments still work the same
way, thus learning an abstract description of shared physical
dynamics helps human to understand the world. In this paper,
we explore building this mental world with neural network
models through multi-task learning, namely the meta-world
model. We show through extensive experiments that our proposed
meta-world models successfully capture the common
dynamics over the compact representations of visually different
environments from Atari Games. We also demonstrate
that agents equipped with our meta-world model possess the
ability of visual self-recognition, i.e., pass the classic mirror
self-recognition test (MSR).
