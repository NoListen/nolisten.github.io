- I'm pursuing my Computer Science PhD in University of Manchester, supervised by [Dr. Ke Chen](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~kechen/). Previously, I obtained my Master degree from UCL under the supervison of [Prof. Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/Jun.Wang/) in 2018. I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where my undergraduate supervisors are [Prof. Yong Yu](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu) and [Prof. Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/).

- My research mainly focuses on representation learning for control now. I am interested in how to make use of reinforcement learning to learn adaptive learning methods to different domains, make consciousness modeling and robotic control .

# Recent Activities
- September 2020. Started my PhD in University of Manchester.
- Novemver, 2019. One [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04444) accepted by AAAI 2020.
- September, 2019. One paper [MVRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08285) accepted by NeurIPS 2019.
- November, 2018. Joined Wayve to work on robotics and imitation learning in Cambridge.
- April, 2018. I build one [bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge) reinforcement learning [environment](https://github.com/NoListen/bridge_env) based on [Double Dummy Solver](https://github.com/dds-bridge/dds) designed for bidding task in bridge game.
- March, 2018. Intergrate [rllab](https://github.com/rll/rllab) hierarchical reinforcement learning [gather](https://github.com/rll/rllab/tree/master/rllab/envs/mujoco/gather) and [maze](https://github.com/rll/rllab/tree/master/rllab/envs/mujoco/maze) into openai gym environment.
- January, 2018. Find a bug in openai baseline [TRPO](https://github.com/openai/baselines/issues/262) implementation.
- September, 2017. Rewrite the [StarCraft I API](https://github.com/alibaba/gym-starcraft) of Alibaba using TorchCraft v 1.3.0 and extend the [environment](https://github.com/NoListen/gym-starcraft) to include more features. An implementation of [BiCNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10069.pdf) on StarCraft I is available in [RL-forest](https://github.com/NoListen/RL-forest/tree/master/RL_forest/ddpg_plant/multi_ddpg).
- May, 2017. Implement the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01310.pdf) and achieve average 2500 on Atari Game [Montezuma Revenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montezuma%27s_Revenge_(video_game)).
